CREDIT CARD FRAUD DETECTION

PROJECT SUMMARY : 

There are thousands of credit card transactions made on a daily basis. Many of these transactions are found to be fraud. This project aims at identifying these fraudulent transactions by determining the outliers and anomalies in the data set so that the customers of credit card companies are not charged for items that they did not purchase.
 
CHALLENGES : 
 
The model must be fast enough to respond to the fraudulent transaction in time.
Most of the transactions (99.8%) are not fraudulent which makes it really hard for detecting the fraudulent ones
Data is mostly private, so data availability is a challenge
The scammers might use some adaptive techniques against the model therefore making the detection difficult. 
 
PROSPECTIVE SOLUTIONS : 
 
The model used must be simple and fast enough to detect the anomaly and classify it as a fraudulent transaction as quickly as possible.
For protecting the privacy of the user, the dimensionality of the data can be reduced.
A more trustworthy source must be taken which double-checks the data, at least for training the model.
We can make the model simple and interpret-able so that when the scammer adapts to it with just some tweaks we can have a new model up and running to deploy.


SCOPE : 

This project is basically made for credit card companies so they can identify the fraudulent transactions and do not have to charge their customers for payments 
that are unaccounted by them. Also, recognizing the fraud in time can help them identify the scammers in time and hand them to the law so that such incidents donâ€™t 
occur.
